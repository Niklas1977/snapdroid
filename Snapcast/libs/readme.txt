If you want to use local AAR packages, and not download them from GithubPackages, 
place them in this directory:

- boost-1.75.0
- flac-1.3.3.3
- oboe-1.5.0
- ogg-1.3.4
- opus-1.1.2
- soxr-0.1.3.2
- tremor-1.0.0

you can download the aar files from here:
https://github.com/badaix/snapcast-deps/releases/tag/v0.24.0

If you want to use the GithubPackages repository, you must provide a github user and token 
with read:packages permission via the environment variables GITHUB_USER and GITHUB_TOKEN
